With your <strong>one and a half meters</strong> of height, you prove that great things come in small packages – and what an adorable package it is! 😊 I love it when you get annoyed over <strong>silly</strong> things; you look so <strong>cute</strong> that I can't take it seriously. 😄 Who would have thought that my favorite pastime would be teasing you just to see that little angry face that makes me laugh? 😜</p> <p>But seriously, <strong>Ana Elizabeth Von Wurmb da Silva</strong>, these last five years have been the best of my life. Every day by your side is <strong>wonderful</strong>, and I wouldn't trade our craziness for anything. You are the person who completes me and makes me want to be better. Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my <strong>eternally</strong> favorite little grumpy one. 💖 I can't wait to continue this journey with you, teasing, laughing, and loving a lot. 💑</p> <p>With all the love and some laughs, <italic>Cleber</italic> 😘❤️🥰</p>"
